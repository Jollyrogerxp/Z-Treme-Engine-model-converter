For Sonic Z-Treme, to recompile the Sonic model : 
Keyframes = 30
USE SGL = 1
Scale factor = 4
IN/SONIC/
SONIC

The scale with older version of Sonic Z-Treme will be wrong since it now uses a 8.8 fixed format instead of 7.9 like before.
Update the Sonic Z-Treme code to support 8.8 instead.


The anorm obj was simply used to generate the compressed normals
